# Welcome to the Paladins!

Since we're currently in off-season, we'll be spending some time working on our design, build, and programming skills! The Paladins of St Paul's are currently competing in the virtual Student Robotics Competition ([studentrobotics.org](https://www.studentrobotics.org/) - we're team SPA! If you're interested, you can see our current python code [here](https://github.com/Paladins-of-St-Pauls/StudentRobotics/blob/master/robot.py)). The Student Robotics competition uses the [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) robot simulator, along with the Python programming language. There's some great [Microgames](https://studentrobotics.org/resources/sr2021/microgames-sr2021.pdf) that we'll be following along with which provide a fantastic introduction to text-based programming for robotics for beginners. Anyone who's finding the Microgames easy are welcome to set themselves their own challenges, and any 'Student Robotics Whizzes' can absolutely join our SR Team!

Before we can get started with the games though, we'll need to install Webots, StudentRobotics, and Python (if you don't already have version 3.7/3.8) - Here's the basic rundown of what we'll be doing to get setup:

- Install Webots from [cyberbotics.com](https://cyberbotics.com/).
- Download the StudentRobotics Module 1 code from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/Paladins-of-St-Pauls/Rookies-StudentRobotics).
- (May be required) Install Python 3.7 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/), and configure Webots (This step can be tricky - we can help you with that!)
- (Optional, but highly recommended) Install a more powerful text editor (we recommend Visual Studio Code, which you can get [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- That's it - time to code! All of our code will be in the _robot.py_ file.
